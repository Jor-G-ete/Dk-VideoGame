This is the first version of a video game made by the python library pyxel: https://github.com/kitao/pyxel.

This time is Mario who is being saved by Peach.

The logic of the game is basic, barrels going down either by the floors or the stairs( which are generated randomly).

The idea was just to learn python and try to code a simple and fun game in python. Excuse the mistakes which can be found

**Any help or improved is welcomed, so don't be afraid and join in! :)**
